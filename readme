SPECIAL NOTE about BindingResult Parameter Order:
	When performing Spring MVC validation, the location of the BindingResult parameter is very important. 
	In the method signature, the BindingResult parameter must appear immediately after the model attribute.
	If you place it in any other location, Spring MVC validation will not work as desired. In fact, your validation rules will be ignored.
		@RequestMapping("/processForm")
        public String processForm(
                @Valid @ModelAttribute("customer") Customer theCustomer,
                BindingResult theBindingResult) {
            ...            
        }
